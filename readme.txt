1. Install necessary dependencies:

pip install gradio pandas matplotlib seaborn ollama pydantic

2. Install ollama:
    For Macbook M1 :
        brew install ollama
    Then, download the recommended Llama 3.1 8B model (or a smaller version for performance).
    I've downloaded Llama3:latest

After that you have to verify whether ollama is properly installed or not. For me it is showing following thing:

    ollama list
NAME             ID              SIZE      MODIFIED    
llama3:latest    365c0bd3c000    4.7 GB    2 hours ago    
nawdeepkumar@NAWDEEPs-MacBook-2 ~ % ollama run llama3 "Hello, what is your name?"

3. Ensure Pydantic AI is installed.
    pip install pydantic-ai

4. Now, create a Python script (app.py) with the implementation and run.

5. You can run the a.py also to show clean csv file uploaded message.

6. You can run c.py , it is fully running.
